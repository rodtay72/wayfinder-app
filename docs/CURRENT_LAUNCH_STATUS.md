## Production smoke checklist (after user-facing merge)

1. Verified user can sign in.
2. Dashboard loads Parent ID, children, past activities, reflections.
3. Journal save appears in Journal Trail.
4. Sign-out works; unverified email blocked.
5. No parent email or Supabase UUID in normal UI.
6. Decode a Moment and ALIGN Journey still usable if touched.
7. Mobile layout readable.

## Agent ops notes

- One branch, one merge at a time.
- Use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for every PR.
- High-risk paths require CODEOWNERS review once branch protection is enabled.
- Platform sync brief required for user-facing, research, consent, or AI changes.
